# Mortgage repayment calculator



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge.This is an evaluation task for the job application due to a high number of applicants. The evaluation criteria will be

Adherence to the design - Pixel Perfect design
Understanding of Requirements on the first go(No Scope for Q&A Clarifications during the challenge)
Availability of Developer
Speed of Development
Code Quality
Best practices from Production grade environments 
Documentation

We reserve the right to reject the candidate if the above criteria is not met. We reserve the right to final decisions. Acceptance to the challenge is not a guarantee for the job.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with NextJS .**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this mortgage repayment calculator using **NEXTJS** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design as well as a Figma file. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
3. Deploy your project to Vercel - Vercel

## Deploying your project

Recommended hosts :

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.
